# Project Status

## Current handoff

- Template cleanup: Completed 2026-10-16. Initialized workflow records for the
  established project; preserved its README, implementation, product documents,
  and history. Do not repeat initialization cleanup.
- Last updated: 2026-11-07 (Europe/Berlin).
- State / scope: `M-FLATPAK-PAGES-20261107` in progress; the contributor workflow
  migration is complete. See [the brief](project.md) for selected acceptance.
- Observed baseline: Clean `main` at `4afa9f478dbb5e028f63431610016ae882ca9732`,
  matching live `origin/main`; product version and latest published release `2.11.3`.
- Latest verified result: Signed repository built from both real `v2.11.3` bundles;
  isolated Flatpak clients resolve both signed architecture refs. All 90 Python
  tooling tests, actionlint, YAML parsing and diff whitespace checks passed.
- Next concrete action: After explicit user consent, upload the private signing
  key as the repository's Actions secret, set its public fingerprint variable,
  enable Pages (Actions), verify environment deployment rules, push the prepared
  commit and dispatch `flatpak-pages.yaml`; verify live descriptors and both refs.
- Required input: Explicit approval to upload the private key to Actions secret
  `FLATPAK_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` in `VoltKraft/immich-folder-watch` and activate Pages.
  Automatic approval review rejected the combined external setup command because
  this sensitive-key transfer was not explicitly authorized. The command did not
  execute. No push, remote secret/variable update or Pages activation occurred.

## Goal run reference

- Goal requested for this assignment: No. No Goal was started.
- Actual Goal state in another chat: Not inspected; this document neither activates
  nor transfers a run. Query actual Goal controls if a continuation refers to one.
- Selected Goal milestone / criteria snapshot / budget: Not applicable.

## Progress and evidence

| Milestone / criteria | Status | Evidence / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `M-TEMPLATE-MIGRATION-20261016`, `TM-AC01` through `TM-AC04` | Verified | Guarded apply and preservation/static checks passed; see historical validation record and local recovery bundle |
| `M-FLATPAK-PAGES-20261107`, `FP-AC01`/`02`/`03`/`05` | Locally verified | Implementation, real signed bundles, regression tests, review and docs complete |
| `M-FLATPAK-PAGES-20261107`, `FP-AC04` | Pending approval | External setup rejected before execution; live deployment remains to be verified |

## Flatpak distribution validation (2026-11-07)

| Check | Result / evidence | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Existing release inputs | GitHub API confirmed stable `v2.11.3`; x64 bundle 34,198,880 bytes, ARM64 bundle 30,983,120 bytes | Existing release assets were read/downloaded, not changed |
| Real repository generation | Both bundles imported and signed with fingerprint `4ED65AC1C14D559C721C7A8B44B33451708EAD7D`; complete site is about 87 MiB on disk at ignored `artifacts/flatpak-pages-preview/` | Local staging only; no Pages deployment |
| Real client discovery | Isolated `flatpak remote-add` with public key and `remote-info` resolved x86_64 commit `bdcfdb3e896ca6be8c9d0b93e5947884711e2c56da1da3a6cecbfcbe89200bcf` and aarch64 commit `86250534e754a0fa6c2d0ab1236bf87e862599416f0871d979e424ced402e30b` | No installation in the real user profile, runtime download or app execution |
| Python tooling tests | `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v`: 90 passed, including seven new repository tests | Initial sandbox run failed because gpg-agent sockets were denied; rerun with approved isolated local execution passed |
| Repository integration regression checks | Signed multiarchitecture import, updates after complete repo replacement, unsigned-summary rejection, `.flatpakref` client consumption, malformed input/branch and size-limit rejection all passed | Synthetic fixture updates; real app update across published Pages versions not yet observed |
| Workflows and review | All workflow YAML parses; actionlint passed for all workflows; independent read-only review found no actionable defects; `git diff --check` passed | GitHub-hosted workflow execution pending; verify Pages environment permits release-tag events |
| New action licenses | Official upstream MIT licenses verified for configure-pages, upload-pages-artifact and deploy-pages | CI-only additions; no application dependencies changed |
| Remote activation | Blocked by automatic approval reviewer before execution | Explicit approval for private-key transfer is required; live URL checks pending |
| Application/desktop/Immich tests | Not run | Distribution-only change; no application code changes |

## Historical migration validation record

| Check | Result / evidence | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Git state | Clean at migration baseline `3d41ef56b524b7acfa11559859fc0c7dab0daa73`; inspected with `git --no-optional-locks -C <repository> status --porcelain=v2 --branch --untracked-files=all` and both working/staged diffs | Local refs only; no fetch |
| Old agent provenance | All 37 old `.codex` tracked files match template commit `fe6db7f7e7e65f076b5dc0706fc6d46eba6de14b` | Confirms no target-specific profile customizations |
| Applied Markdown links, TOML, scoped diff, content preservation | Passed: 11 Markdown files, 90 local links/anchors, 35 TOML files / 34 roles; 298 unaffected original files retain identical SHA-256 hashes. Reports: local `inspection-after.json` and `integrity.json` in the recovery bundle. | Static checks; ignored artifacts, nested checkouts, and runtime data are outside the content manifest |
| Application builds/tests, packaging, desktop checks, live Immich | Not run for this documentation/configuration-only assignment | No runtime, UI, sync, installer, or service validation implied |
| Existing QA reports | Retained as historical evidence at their original revisions | Migration does not renew their sign-offs or fill blank acceptance rows |

## Open questions and blockers

| ID | Question / missing prerequisite | Impact and next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IFW-Q01 | Resolved: GitHub Pages Flatpak distribution selected on 2026-11-07. | See `M-FLATPAK-PAGES-20261107`. |
| IFW-Q04 | Private signing-key upload and Pages activation need explicit consent after automatic approval rejection. | Local implementation/tests are complete. Resume the exact external setup above after approval, then publish and verify live endpoints. |
| IFW-Q02 | Older README/architecture summaries call Flatpak tray support disabled, while detailed architecture, parity notes, and later changelog describe restricted tray integration. Some QA labels also predate current modes. | Pre-existing documentation discrepancy, outside this migration. Reconcile against code and actual desktop evidence in a separately selected task; do not infer runtime behavior from either summary. |
| IFW-Q03 | Native desktop acceptance and actual Flathub publication are not established by the inspected historical preparation record. | Keep the existing QA boundaries; verify only when the corresponding task and environment are authorized. |

## Completion and next handoff

- Historical workflow migration is complete at `4afa9f4`; recovery evidence remains
  in [the migration record](template-migration.md).
- `FP-AC01`, `FP-AC02`, `FP-AC03` and `FP-AC05` have local implementation and
  validation evidence. `FP-AC04` is pending external activation and live checks;
  the distribution milestone remains incomplete.
- Deliverables: Repository generator/tests, Pages workflow and release dispatch,
  public signing key, installation/migration/operations documentation and CI wiring.
- Private recovery key: ignored `artifacts/flatpak-signing/private-key.asc`, mode
  0600 inside a mode-0700 directory. Public key only is included in Git.
- Checkpoint: Prepared implementation and explicit activation blocker saved in a
  scoped local commit; the chat handoff records its hash. No version/tag change.
