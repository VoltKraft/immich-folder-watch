# Project Status

## Directory race follow-up (2026-11-10)

- Selected milestone: `M-WATCH-ROOT-ATOMICITY-20261110`; implementation and local
  validation complete; Windows CI and PR update pending.
- Baseline: clean local and remote PR head `d922bfa86df14408185e811e230167705354dc7c`.
  PR #26 is open, draft, unmerged, targeting `main`; existing branch is reused.
- User scope: completely close the remaining watch-directory race, with subagents
  and regression tests in the same PR. No merge or release.
- Ownership: native filesystem abstraction and platform tests; worker/API integration;
  independent security review. Parent owns records, integration checks and commits.
- WR-AC01: Pinned native Linux/Windows filesystem primitives and worker/API
  integration cover enumeration, absence, reads, downloads, exact-file cleanup,
  timestamps and both ends of directory moves. Roots outlive callbacks/retries.
- WR-AC02: Linux local validation passes; Windows runtime CI remains required.
  Capability checks fail closed. The [watch-root contract](watch-root-security.md)
  documents retained Linux containers, bounded cache and Windows sharing locks.
- WR-AC03: 33 added regression cases (20 native, 5 API, 8 worker), including
  deterministic root/parent/leaf changes, same-fingerprint replacement cleanup,
  legacy content IDs, journal recovery, remote cleanup and shutdown lifetime.
- WR-AC04: Independent review found no remaining actionable source issue after
  corrections for identity, bounded handle caching, stale cleanup/album authority,
  retries and lifecycle. Documentation is updated; same-PR push and CI pending.
- Next action: push the reviewed implementation to PR #26 and validate Windows
  and native package CI. Retain draft status; no merge or release.
- Goal controls: no new Goal requested or started; prior run remains historical.

### Directory race validation (2026-11-10)

| Check | Result | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Portable Core suite | 481 passed, 0 failed/skipped | Linux x86_64, SDK 10.0.203; final album-cache revocation delta then passed 10 targeted album/security cases |
| Native focused suite | 20 passed, including LRU eviction with active leases and exclusive writer locks | Windows implementation compiles; runtime CI pending |
| Linux GUI/protocol suite | 53 passed, 0 failed/skipped | Headless/local sockets and D-Bus; no live Immich |
| Linux application build/analyzers | Passed | Debug; generated branding remains ignored |
| Independent source review | Passed with no remaining actionable finding | Windows/UNC and ARM64 runtime are separate evidence requirements |
| Diagnostic full run | 468 passed / 4 failed before corrections | Fixed Linux writer-lock handling, retained-container assertions and friendly write-permission errors; subsequent full run passed |
| Security Cloud rescan | Not executed; exposed connector still has no branch/commit selector | No finding was marked closed in the service; exact-commit scan remains outstanding |

## Previous security remediation handoff (2026-11-09)

This section records the earlier partial handoff; the follow-up above supersedes
its filesystem disposition and next action.

- Milestone: `M-SECURITY-REMEDIATION-20261109`; remediation pass delivered in draft PR #26, with one explicitly open residual finding.
- Goal run: requested and executed in chat `01a1c1ee-b279-76d2-8529-eaf116140007`, created
  2026-11-09; criteria SEC-AC01 through SEC-AC05 fixed in the selected brief. The user later
  explicitly reaffirmed subagent use; focused implementation and independent reviews
  were used. Completion permits explicitly documented unresolved findings. The remediation
  assignment is delivered; the filesystem finding remains explicitly open and
  the PR is not ready to merge.
- Baseline: refreshed `origin/main`, `26a0de519ee4f7eae2e556b8da7726539d578594`;
  initially clean. Working branch: `security/remediate-all-findings`.
- Discovery: 14 new findings (11 medium, 3 low) from completed repository scan
  `wfr_1cb38532afa4dc13e4acdc43f5953f4ebd3b4308486bbadb640050a3194de7fb`,
  target `3d41ef56b524b7acfa11559859fc0c7dab0daa73`, completed 2026-10-03.
  Direct repository-filtered finding lists returned zero; querying the exact scan
  returned all 14 with no further cursor. Full details contain no proposed patches.
- Workstreams: CI/publication credentials, API/transfer bounds, local config/runtime
  security and HTTPS policy, watch-root and remote-album authorization.
- User approved HTTPS-by-default with explicit HTTP exception and `xhigh` rescan.
- Checkpoints: `a303e95` contains reviewed CI hardening; `6e1a781` contains
  application remediation; `cf290b6` corrects the Windows SQLite fixture cleanup. All are pushed to the single
  [draft PR #26](https://github.com/VoltKraft/immich-folder-watch/pull/26), targeting `main`.
  No merge or release was performed.
- Current disposition: 13 findings addressed in code; one partially addressed
  (`csf_77f3e84ec9b70e5aff765235`, concurrent watch-directory replacement).
  Full mapping, compatibility changes and residual risks are in
  [the remediation record](security-remediation-20261109.md).
- Independent reviewers checked CI trust, native Linux storage, REST/download
  bounds, realtime adapters and album authority. Review-driven corrections cover
  redirect/buffering in SocketIO and stale authority after failed/offline/rapid
  folder renames. No remaining actionable issue in those reviewed fixes; the
  acknowledged handle-bound filesystem gap remains open.
- Next action: review the single PR; retain draft status until the open filesystem
  race is resolved and exact-commit security validation can be arranged. All six CI jobs passed on `cf290b6`; this final handoff updates documentation only.
  No additional milestone was selected.

### Security validation (2026-11-09)

| Check | Result | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Portable Core tests | 448 passed on final combined rerun; 0 failed/skipped | .NET 10.0.203 selected by `global.json`; Linux x86_64 |
| Linux GUI/protocol tests | 53 passed | Isolated headless UI, local sockets and D-Bus; no live Immich |
| Linux app build/analyzers | Passed, 0 warnings/errors | Debug build; generated branding not committed |
| Tooling/packaging | 97 Python tests passed, including real PowerShell security scripts and isolated signed Flatpak repository tests | Synthetic keys/artifacts only; no publication |
| Workflow validation | actionlint 1.7.12 passed; YAML parsed; independent CI review passed | No release/WinGet/Flathub dispatch executed |
| Filesystem/album security | Linked entries, ownership scope/restart, exact-ID and stale-ID handling covered | Path checks are not race-proof; Windows reparse/runtime acceptance outstanding |
| Rescan | Not executed: exposed Cloud connector has no documented PR branch/commit selector; no UI available and PR security-review feature disabled | Unchanged-main scan would not validate this branch; arrange exact-commit scan when supported |
| GitHub CI `42693673854` at `6e1a781` | Linux build/tests and packaging lint passed. Windows build passed with 0 warnings/errors; test job exposed pooled SQLite handles in the new ownership test cleanup | Added the repository-standard pool clearing after awaited operations; rerun passed in `42694315680`; Windows-specific 36 tests also passed |
| [GitHub CI `42694315680`](https://github.com/VoltKraft/immich-folder-watch/actions/runs/42694315680) at `cf290b6` | All six jobs passed: Windows/Linux application checks, packaging lint, candidate preparation, and native x86_64/aarch64 packages. Windows: Core 439 passed / 9 platform skips; Windows-specific 36 passed; Linux-project tests 34 passed / 19 platform skips; full solution build 0 warnings/errors; 7 PowerShell security tests passed | Both native x86_64 and aarch64 candidate builds/validation and artifact uploads passed; actual ARM64/UNC app runtime not exercised |
| Superseded native run | Earlier x86_64 candidate could not fetch its replaced synthetic PR merge commit after a new push | No source/compiler failure; current run is authoritative |
| Native runtime limits | Actual ARM64/UNC runtime remains unavailable | Native ABI source inspection and package compilation do not establish runtime behavior |
| Worker follow-up | 54 passed, 1 existing test raced SQLite persistence; moved its database assertion after durable completion and worker stop; final combined rerun passed | No product behavior was changed to satisfy the timing assertion |
| Initial sandbox attempts | VSTest socket and GPG-agent startup were denied; approved isolated reruns passed | Environment failures were not counted as passing tests |
| Repository diff | `git diff --check` passed; 79 local documentation paths checked with no missing targets; final staged artifact review passed | Only task-owned sources/docs/tests are staged |

## Previous completed distribution handoff

- Template cleanup: Completed 2026-10-16. Initialized workflow records for the
  established project; preserved its README, implementation, product documents,
  and history. Do not repeat initialization cleanup.
- Last updated: 2026-11-07 (Europe/Berlin).
- State / scope: `M-FLATPAK-PAGES-20261107` complete. The signed repository is
  live at <https://voltkraft.github.io/immich-folder-watch/>.
- Implementation revision: `48e6be14ccf508385c4b1796842010c09e2d1fb4`, pushed to
  `main`; product version and published bundle inputs remain `2.11.3`.
- Latest verified result: [Pages workflow 42412670753](https://github.com/VoltKraft/immich-folder-watch/actions/runs/42412670753)
  succeeded. Both live descriptors work, and isolated Flatpak clients downloaded
  both complete architecture refs with commit and summary verification enabled.
- Authorization / execution: The user explicitly approved the signing-key upload,
  push and Pages activation on 2026-11-07 after the initial automatic approval
  rejection. The secret and fingerprint variable are configured, Pages uses
  Actions with HTTPS, and its environment allows branch `main` and tags `v*`.
- Next concrete action: No remaining distribution setup. Future stable releases
  dispatch the repository workflow automatically. Preserve the signing-key backup;
  select any subsequent product milestone separately.
- Required input: None.

## Historical distribution Goal reference

- Goal requested for this assignment: No. No Goal was started.
- Actual Goal state in another chat: Not inspected; this document neither activates
  nor transfers a run. Query actual Goal controls if a continuation refers to one.
- Selected Goal milestone / criteria snapshot / budget: Not applicable.

## Progress and evidence

| Milestone / criteria | Status | Evidence / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `M-TEMPLATE-MIGRATION-20261016`, `TM-AC01` through `TM-AC04` | Verified | Guarded apply and preservation/static checks passed; see historical validation record and local recovery bundle |
| `M-FLATPAK-PAGES-20261107`, `FP-AC01`/`02`/`03`/`05` | Verified | Implementation, real signed bundles, regression tests, review and docs complete |
| `M-FLATPAK-PAGES-20261107`, `FP-AC04` | Verified | Explicitly authorized setup and Pages deployment succeeded; live descriptors, both architecture downloads and signature verification passed |

## Flatpak distribution validation (2026-11-07)

| Check | Result / evidence | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Existing release inputs | GitHub API confirmed stable `v2.11.3`; x64 bundle 34,198,880 bytes, ARM64 bundle 30,983,120 bytes | Existing release assets were read/downloaded, not changed |
| Real repository generation | Both bundles imported and signed with fingerprint `4ED65AC1C14D559C721C7A8B44B33451708EAD7D`; complete site is about 87 MiB on disk at ignored `artifacts/flatpak-pages-preview/` | Local staging only; no Pages deployment |
| Real client discovery | Isolated `flatpak remote-add` with public key and `remote-info` resolved x86_64 commit `bdcfdb3e896ca6be8c9d0b93e5947884711e2c56da1da3a6cecbfcbe89200bcf` and aarch64 commit `86250534e754a0fa6c2d0ab1236bf87e862599416f0871d979e424ced402e30b` | No installation in the real user profile, runtime download or app execution |
| Python tooling tests | `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v`: 90 passed, including seven new repository tests | Initial sandbox run failed because gpg-agent sockets were denied; rerun with approved isolated local execution passed |
| Repository integration regression checks | Signed multiarchitecture import, updates after complete repo replacement, unsigned-summary rejection, `.flatpakref` client consumption, malformed input/branch and size-limit rejection all passed | Synthetic fixture updates; real app update across published Pages versions not yet observed |
| Workflows and review | All workflow YAML parses; actionlint passed for all workflows; independent read-only review found no actionable defects; `git diff --check` passed | Pages workflow succeeded; environment permits `main` and release tags `v*` |
| New action licenses | Official upstream MIT licenses verified for configure-pages, upload-pages-artifact and deploy-pages | CI-only additions; no application dependencies changed |
| Remote activation | Completed after explicit consent: `FLATPAK_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` Actions secret, matching `FLATPAK_GPG_KEY_ID` variable, Pages `build_type=workflow`, HTTPS enforced, environment branch `main` / tag `v*` | Private key never printed or committed; previous rejection is resolved |
| Pages publication | Build and deployment both succeeded in [run 42412670753](https://github.com/VoltKraft/immich-folder-watch/actions/runs/42412670753) from `48e6be1` | Publishes existing `v2.11.3` assets; no product release or tag was created |
| Live HTTPS endpoints | HTTP 200 for index, `.flatpakrepo`, `.flatpakref`, public key, repo config, summary and summary signature | Evidence saved locally in ignored `artifacts/flatpak-pages-live-verification.json` |
| Live client verification | Fresh isolated `.flatpakrepo` client resolves both expected commits; a separate `.flatpakref` client downloads complete x86_64 and aarch64 apps from Pages, with `gpg-verify=true` and `gpg-verify-summary=true` | Used `--no-deps --no-related --no-deploy`; no real-user installation, runtime download or application execution; future-version update remains covered by the local integration regression test |
| GitHub packaging CI | `Lint Flatpak packaging` passed in [run 42412671037](https://github.com/VoltKraft/immich-folder-watch/actions/runs/42412671037), including repository tests | Broader application tests and native candidate builds were still running at handoff; no application code changed |
| Local application/desktop/Immich tests | Not run | Distribution-only change; live distribution was verified without application execution |

## Historical migration validation record

| Check | Result / evidence | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Git state | Clean at migration baseline `3d41ef56b524b7acfa11559859fc0c7dab0daa73`; inspected with `git --no-optional-locks -C <repository> status --porcelain=v2 --branch --untracked-files=all` and both working/staged diffs | Local refs only; no fetch |
| Old agent provenance | All 37 old `.codex` tracked files match template commit `fe6db7f7e7e65f076b5dc0706fc6d46eba6de14b` | Confirms no target-specific profile customizations |
| Applied Markdown links, TOML, scoped diff, content preservation | Passed: 11 Markdown files, 90 local links/anchors, 35 TOML files / 34 roles; 298 unaffected original files retain identical SHA-256 hashes. Reports: local `inspection-after.json` and `integrity.json` in the recovery bundle. | Static checks; ignored artifacts, nested checkouts, and runtime data are outside the content manifest |
| Application builds/tests, packaging, desktop checks, live Immich | Not run for this documentation/configuration-only assignment | No runtime, UI, sync, installer, or service validation implied |
| Existing QA reports | Retained as historical evidence at their original revisions | Migration does not renew their sign-offs or fill blank acceptance rows |

## Open questions and blockers

| ID | Question / missing prerequisite | Impact and next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IFW-Q01 | Resolved: GitHub Pages Flatpak distribution selected on 2026-11-07. | See `M-FLATPAK-PAGES-20261107`. |
| IFW-Q04 | Resolved: explicit user consent received; secret upload, push, Pages activation and live validation completed. | No remaining activation blocker. |
| IFW-Q02 | Older README/architecture summaries call Flatpak tray support disabled, while detailed architecture, parity notes, and later changelog describe restricted tray integration. Some QA labels also predate current modes. | Pre-existing documentation discrepancy, outside this migration. Reconcile against code and actual desktop evidence in a separately selected task; do not infer runtime behavior from either summary. |
| IFW-Q03 | Native desktop acceptance and actual Flathub publication are not established by the inspected historical preparation record. | Keep the existing QA boundaries; verify only when the corresponding task and environment are authorized. |

## Completion and next handoff

- Historical workflow migration is complete at `4afa9f4`; recovery evidence remains
  in [the migration record](template-migration.md).
- `FP-AC01` through `FP-AC05` are complete; local and live evidence is recorded above.
- Deliverables: Repository generator/tests, Pages workflow and release dispatch,
  public signing key, installation/migration/operations documentation and CI wiring.
- Private recovery key: ignored `artifacts/flatpak-signing/private-key.asc`, mode
  0600 inside a mode-0700 directory. Public key only is included in Git.
- Checkpoint: Implementation `48e6be1` is published; this completion record and
  installation-document updates are saved in a separate documentation checkpoint,
  whose hash is recorded in the chat handoff. No version/tag change.
